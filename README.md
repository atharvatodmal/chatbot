The history of chatbots dates back to 1966 when Weizenbaum invented a computer program called ELIZA that could imitate a psychotherapist's language using just 200 lines of code. You can still interact with ELIZA today. In a similar vein, a basic chatbot can be created using Python's NLTK library.
Although this chatbot does not possess advanced cognitive abilities, it is an excellent way to delve into the realm of NLP and learn about chatbots. The purpose of this project was not to create an exceptional chatbot, but to utilize the newly acquired knowledge of NLP. The code for the chatbot can be found in the given link, along with a demonstration. Prior to building the chatbot, one must have knowledge of the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, which is a practical tool for programming in natural language processing using Python.
