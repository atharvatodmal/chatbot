# Chatbot

History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: Eliza.

On similar lines let's create a very basic chatbot utlising the Python's NLTK library.It's a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills,but still a good way to get into NLP and get to know about chatbots.

The idea of this project was not to create some chatbot with exceptional cognitive skills but just to utilise.This was one of my very few projects, 
created when I just stepped into the world of NLP and I thought of creating a simple chatbot just to make use of my newly acquired knowledge.
